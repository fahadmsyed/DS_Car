# DS_Traffic
This is by far the most expansive project I have done in C. It utilizes a variety of different data structures, including Graphs, Hash Tables, and Queues/Priority Queues. The purpose of the program is to simulate traffic on a road, with various cars and their paths being stored at all times. It is also capable of handling intersections as well as roads of different lengths.

This project includes its executable, driver, so there is no need to use the makefile.
